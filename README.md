🚀 Hotel Popularity Index! 🏨 

🌟 Project Highlights: 
▫️ Objective: Develop a scoring/ranking system for hotels using features like location, property type, and price per night. 
▫️ Dataset: Web-scraped from Bukit Vista’s property list. 
▫️ Methods:
 1️⃣ Set feature weights (e.g., Price: 30%, Bedrooms: 20%, Bathrooms: 15%). 
 2️⃣ Normalization using Min-Max scaling for fair comparison. 
 3️⃣ Computed a composite score for the Popularity Index by summing weighted scores. 
 4️⃣ Data preprocessing to handle missing and inconsistent data. 

 🎯 Results:
I deployed this project using Streamlit to showcase: 
- A table of top-ranked hotels, 
- Popularity Index visualized through charts, 
- And a customizable weight feature for users to refine rankings. 

📈 Benefits: 
1️⃣ Assists travelers in finding high-value properties.
2️⃣ Provides businesses with actionable insights to enhance their offerings.
3️⃣ Demonstrates advanced data science techniques like feature scaling and weighted scoring.
